Simulated Annealing on a Synthetic Netflix Dataset

This project applies the Simulated Annealing (SA) optimization algorithm on a synthetic Netflix dataset to explore how heuristic methods can be used to solve complex, real-world-style problems.

Key Highlights:
- Uses a synthetically generated Netflix dataset simulating content attributes, ratings, and viewer patterns  
- Applies the Simulated Annealing algorithm to optimize a cost or objective function  
- Compares SA performance with brute force and greedy approaches where applicable  
- Visualizes convergence behavior, temperature decay, and solution evolution over time  
- Demonstrates the utility of metaheuristics in decision-making for recommendation or scheduling problems

Files Included
- `SA Code.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with SA implementation  
- `combined_netflix_data.csv`: Synthetic dataset used for testing the algorithm  
- `README.md`: This documentation

Tech Stack
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
